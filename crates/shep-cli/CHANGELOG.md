## [Unreleased]

### Additions

- Add the clap command tree (`Cli`, `Commands`, and every argument struct
  the CLI will ever parse — `Start`, `Stop`/`Restart`/`Delete`/`Describe`,
  `Flock` (aliases `list`/`ls`), `Fold`, `Bleats` (alias `logs`), `Ping`,
  `Kill`, `Completions`, the hidden `Thatlldo` and `Daemon`), pure tier so
  it compiles and its tests run on Windows.
- Add the process exit-code taxonomy (`ExitCode`, matching spec §9's table
  exactly, values included) with its stable `code_str` spelling and a
  `From<RpcErrorCode>` conversion; the three `From<&shep_client::*Error>`
  conversions are unix-only, since the error types they read from are.
- Add `main`'s dispatch skeleton: argument parsing, `$SHEP_HOME` resolution
  from `--home`/`$SHEP_HOME`/`$HOME`, and a placeholder arm for every verb —
  each replaced by its own command module as that verb is implemented.
- Exit code 2 (`Usage`) is clap's own convention for bad arguments and
  collides with the fail-fast code spec §9 reserves for the `runtime`
  subcommand's own use. `runtime` is out of scope for this phase; whichever
  task builds it resolves the collision deliberately, rather than
  discovering it.
- Carry `ProcessInfo`'s new `out_file`/`err_file` in every `--json` payload
  built from `FlockRows` (`flock`, `describe`, `fold`, `start`, `stop`,
  `restart`). They are `JSON_ONLY`, not columns: absolute log paths are
  routinely longer than the rest of the row put together and would wreck the
  table those verbs exist to print.
- Add the end-to-end test tier (`tests/cli_e2e.rs`): the real `shep` binary
  against a real daemon, a real socket, and real spawned sheep, each on a
  fresh `$SHEP_HOME`. Covers autostart from cold, daemon reuse across
  commands, the concurrent cold-start race, exit codes and stdout/stderr
  stream discipline under `--format json`, `kill`'s socket teardown,
  `bleats --no-follow` against real log files (both default and `--out`),
  and that an autostarted daemon binds under the `--home` it was given
  rather than an ambient `$SHEP_HOME`. Unix-only (`#![cfg(unix)]`): an
  integration test file is its own compilation unit, so without the gate
  `--all-targets` would build it — with its unix-only `nix` dev-dependency —
  on the Windows CI leg too.
- Commit `--format json` fixtures for `flock`, `describe`, `start`, `ping`
  and `bleats --no-follow` under `tests/fixtures/*.json` (IR-35's byte-fixture
  discipline, same as the wire protocol). The four envelopes are compared
  structurally, with the fields a real spawned process cannot pin across
  runs (`pid`, `uptime_ms`, `out_file`, `err_file`) asserted against their
  own real shape and then normalized before the comparison; `bleats
  --no-follow`'s one JSON-line-per-record output carries no envelope (see
  its own entry below) and is compared byte-for-byte.
- `DaemonAlreadyRunning = 10` is a cross-crate contract, not an internal
  implementation detail: `shep-client`'s `spawn::DAEMON_ALREADY_RUNNING`
  hard-codes the same number so `connect_or_spawn` can tell "a losing
  cold-start racer's daemon exited on purpose" apart from every other exit,
  which is what lets both sides of a concurrent `shep start` race exit 0
  (Task 12's end-to-end tier proves this against two real, genuinely
  concurrent invocations). Changing either side without the other
  reintroduces the race — `exit.rs`'s own test pins the two constants equal.

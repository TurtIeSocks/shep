//! Async client for the shep daemon: connect-or-spawn state machine, typed
//! wrappers for every RPC verb, and event-bus subscription streams. This is
//! the programmatic API embedders use; the CLI is a thin consumer of it.
//!
//! Re-exports [`shep_core`] so downstream users need a single dependency.
//! Module-by-module design: `docs/systematic-refactor/refactor-workspace/map.md`.
